Hello!

My name is Bryan Shang and this is the very first game I have built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
I was aided with prompts from FreeCodeCamp.com and used a bit of ChatGPT to debug my code.
Please feel free to copy and improve on my small project. I hope I will be able to make more complex structures and programs as I continue to learn FrontEnd Dev


Options I would like to work on and would appreciate help with include:
-Armor mechanics
-mana/magic
-more monsters
-more weapons
-graphics 
-character selection

-...(I will add more as they come)
